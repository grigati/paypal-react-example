## PayPal Checkout Integration with React Example

This PayPal Checkout integration uses the PayPal JavaScript SDK released in February 2019.

### First Steps

Before developing code, make sure you get PayPal REST API credentials from the [Developer Portal](https://developer.paypal.com/).

In the file PaypalButton.js, replace 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID' with your REST API credentials. See [the documentation for customizing the SDK](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/reference/customize-sdk/) for a complete list of query parameters and values.

## Running the Project

### Setting Up the Project for the First Time

After cloning or downloading the project files, go to the project directory and run this command:

`npm install`

This will install all packages required to run the projects, as well as any packages that they depend on. This step may take a few minutes to finish.

### Running the Project

To run the project, use this command in the project directory:

`npm start`

A browser tab will open. If that doesn't happen, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
